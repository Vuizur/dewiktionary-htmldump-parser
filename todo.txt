*Make usable for different languages
*Add inflections from pages like https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/absentizmus to other pages
*Fix the bug that appears because I tried to find compound words in a split string
*Check if the same method as for the flexion namespace can be used for the main one (table extraction)
*Skip all entries in the inflection table that contain a href that contains "Hilfe:"
