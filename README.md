# De-Wiktionary HTML dump parser

This project parses the German Wiktionary HTML dump (right now to extract Czech-German data) into JSON that can easily be used in any application. 

Other projects parsing the German Wiktionary use the XML dump, but this has the downside of not getting any data from expanded templates. For many languages the inflections are not manually typed in, but instead generated by a Lua template. These can only be accessed by parsing the HTML directly.
